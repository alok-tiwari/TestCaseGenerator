Feature: Verify the requirement is implemented - The system analyzes real-time sensor data from HVAC, lighting, and energy systems.
  As a user
  I want to perform the required actions
  So that achieve the desired functionality

  Background:
    Given the system is in a known state


  Scenario: Verify the requirement is implemented - The system analyzes real-time sensor data from HVAC, lighting, and energy systems.
        When the requirement is implemented

  Scenario: Verify the requirement is implemented - Users receive alerts when equipment performance deviates from normal operational thresholds.
        When the requirement is implemented

  Scenario: Verify the requirement is implemented - Alerts include recommended actions and expected risk levels.
        When the requirement is implemented

  Scenario: Verify Users - view alert history and filter by equipment type or location.
        When Users

  Scenario: Verify Alerts - be delivered via email, mobile notifications, or dashboard pop-ups.
        When Alerts

  Scenario: Verify the requirement is implemented - The system updates predictive analytics every 10 minutes to maintain accuracy.
        When the requirement is implemented

  Scenario: Verify Given/When/Then Example:Given I am logged into the EcoStruxure™ platformWhen the system detects abnormal behavior in a piece of equipmentThen I - receive a maintenance alert with recommended actionAnd I should be able to view historical alerts and trends for that equipment
        Given Given/When/Then Example:Given I am logged into the EcoStruxure™ platformWhen the system detects abnormal behavior in a piece of equipmentThen I

  Scenario: System Context Verification Test
        Given Verify technology stack compatibility
    Given Verify user role functionality
