can you create test case for this acceptance criteria, give good coverage with minimum test case?This story addresses the IP address field changing validation type to ipv4/ipv6 (will address problem statement) and setting the default value of the field to blank.IPv6 address validation test cases cover various aspects to ensure an address conforms to the standard. These cases can be broadly categorized into positive (valid addresses) and negative (invalid addresses). Positive Test Cases (Valid IPv6 Addresses): Full Address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 Zero Compression (Single): 2001:db8::1 (single :: for consecutive zero segments) Zero Compression (Multiple): 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (single :: can only appear once) Loopback Address: ::1 Unspecified Address: :: Link-Local Address: fe80::1 (starting with fe80::/10) IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address: ::ffff:192.0.2.1 (combining IPv6 and IPv4 notation) Addresses with Leading Zeros: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 (valid, but can be compressed) Uppercase and Lowercase Hex Digits: 2001:DB8:85A3:0:0:8A2E:370:7334 Negative Test Cases (Invalid IPv6 Addresses): Invalid Number of Segments: Too few: 2001:db8:85a3:8a2e:0370:7334 (missing segments, no ::) Too many: 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:0370:7334:1 Invalid Characters: 2001:db8:85a3:g000::1 (contains 'g', which is not a hex digit) Invalid Segment Length: 2001:db8:85a3:00000:0:8a2e:0370:7334 (segment longer than 4 hex digits) Multiple Zero Compressions: 2001::db8::1 (multiple :: invalid) Invalid IPv4-Mapped Format: ::ffff:192.0.2.256 (invalid IPv4 portion) Missing Colons: 2001db885a3000000008a2e03707334 Empty Segments (not compressed): 2001:db8::8a2e::7334 (invalid if not using :: for compression) Invalid Prefix Length Notation: 2001:db8::/129 (prefix length exceeds 128) Addresses with Trailing Colons: 2001:db8::: Problem: IP address field will allow users to put spaces at the end of the IP address. This will cause the device to go offline. The Diagnostics error message is not very clear to the user that the IP address is incorrect. Error message: "No such host is known" (or similar) Expected result: The user should not be allowed to enter spaces or bad characters into the IP address field, only numbers and dots. Actual result: User is allowed to add spaces/characters in the IP address AC) Change this to ipv6/ipv4 validation Configuration Settings field says only "IP address" (hostname not there)The user should not be allowed to enter spaces or special characters into the IP address field, only letters, numbers, and dots The default value for the IP address is blank or null (whichever is easier to do)
